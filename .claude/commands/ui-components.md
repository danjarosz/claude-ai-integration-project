## Task

Make a single UI component following these guidelines:

- Create the component file in the `src/ui` directory.
- Use a functional component with the name in PascalCase

## Variants

- Add the following variants for the component using the colors from the theme variables in the @src/app/globals.css
  file. 
  - Primary
  - Secondary
  - Success
  - Danger
  - Warning

- Support a common pattern like disabled states and sizes when appropriate (sm, md, lg, default to md when no preferences passed).

## Testing

- Make a test file for the component to test basic use cases.
- Run tests and iterate until all tests pass.

## Previews

- Add the component to the `src/app/preview/page.tsx` file, o it can be viewed in the browser, and use multiple variants.
- Do not add the components to any other page.
