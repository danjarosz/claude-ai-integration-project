## Task

Get a review from the remove repository (Pull request related to the current branch).
Read all inline comments.
Check out if the reported changes are really required. Apply changes to the current branch if needed. If any changes are applied, commit and push the changes. If not, reply to
the review and say why some changes were not required.
